All queries work. Only issue is the create table statements. 
The use of foreign keys makes it wonky. I might be able to 
leave our the declaration of foreign keys. The primary keys don't
screw with any of my testing. 

Try submitting with the original code below;
CREATE TABLE summary_table (
    category_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

--Detailed Table--
CREATE TABLE detailed_table (
    category_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    rental_count INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    inventory_count INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (category_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);



If that doesn't work, then remove the primary and
foreign key references.
